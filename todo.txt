// Question \\
How should the page and the data service deal with the data? 

The component needs some data from a data service.
The data service will get some data from multiple http sources. 
Once all the sources have returned their data, the data service must transform the data before it returns it to the component.


Questions
1. Should the data service return a promise or an observable? I think a promise - The component is only interested in the final data set. 
2. Should the data service use ForkJoin with a dictionary of data sources, and subscribe to that to get all the retrieve data?
3. Is there another pattern that the component should use instead of ngOnInit + setting a flag to say the data is ready?

Double or single quotes?
